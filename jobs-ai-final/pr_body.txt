Chore: rebrand frontend to "Shvii" and light theme

What I changed

- Replaced remaining branding strings: "Jobs.AI" → "Shvii" across frontend pages and README.
- Converted key pages to light theme and ensured consistent use of the brand `primary` token (Calm Indigo):
  - `src/pages/Signup.tsx` (already updated earlier)
  - `src/pages/Login.tsx`
  - `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (header and navigation)
- Moved generated favicon and logo assets into `public/` and updated `index.html` to reference canonical favicon paths.
- Updated `index.html` title and meta description.

Build / verification

- Local production build: PASS (`npm run build` completed; `dist/` generated).
- Snapshot of commit: feature/rebrand-shvii-clean (latest local commit includes all changes).

Files changed (high level)

- `index.html` — title/meta and favicon links
- `src/pages/Login.tsx`, `src/pages/Signup.tsx`, `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`, `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `README.md` — branding update
- `public/` — moved favicons and `shvii-logo.png` into canonical path

Checklist for reviewers

- [ ] Confirm branding text/links display correctly across pages (Login, Signup, Landing, Dashboard)
- [ ] Visual check: header/footer and cards use white background with readable text and the indigo primary color
- [ ] Favicons display correctly in browser tabs (try in an incognito window if caching occurs)
- [ ] CI/build passes on remote (I ran a local `npm run build` that passed)
- [ ] No secrets committed (env variables untouched)

How to preview locally

1. Ensure environment variables are set (e.g. `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Open the dev server (Codespaces: use the forwarded port 5173; locally: http://localhost:5173).
